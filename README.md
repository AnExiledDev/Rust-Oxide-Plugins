## Rust-Oxide-Plugins
These are all the plugins I have developed for Oxide to-date. All are released under the MIT License (See LICENSE.md).

### Explanation of Folders
* Abandoned
    These are plugins that I have created and have either been made obsolete by other plugins (by other developers) or Rust itself. I'd suggest not using these.
* Personal
    These are my personal plugins that I use for a number of things. They likely won't be useful to you unless your a developer. Mostly they just generate lists for me for my wiki at http://wiki.rusthive.com/
* Published
    These plugins are plugins that I have uploaded to the Oxide Resource list. It's always advised that you visit my plugin list here http://oxidemod.org/plugins/authors/waizujin.61644/ rather than using these as they may be unstable or untested. (Beta Versions)
* Un-Published
    This is where I put tiny plugins I made for requests, my own servers, or just better or modified versions of existing plugins.

### Using My Code
These plugins are all yours to use and cannibalize. I ask that you do not upload these plugins anywhere without my permission, but you are welcome to do so as long as you keep the copyright and license intact. Contact me for permission if you need to, I'll most likely say yes, and I don't bite. :)

### Requests
Want a plugin made? Shoot me a message on here or on Oxide (Waizujin) and I'll consider it. I'm always open to making new plugins, no matter how small. Some huge plugins I may not work on, but who knows.

### Donations
If you feel like donating, which isn't a requirement at all, you can send me a message on here and I will send you a paypal link. Might add a fancy button here or something eventually.
